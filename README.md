## About Me

/`My name is Chase Hardy. I'm currently a student at the Colorado School of Mines pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. As such, I am rapidly learning more about software systems and eagerly look forward to further increasing my knowledge.
Prior to the Colorado School of Mines, I worked one semester as a Supplemental Instruction Leader at Front Range Community College. This was an incredible experience that I learned greatly from. I would meet regularly with my paired professor to discuss upcoming topics, attend the classes, and help answer the students' questions. I would also lead two weekly tutoring sessions outside of class, helping the students to better understand this historically difficult subject.
Before that, I worked for a year and a half at Hobby Lobby as a Stock Clerk. Being my first job, this work experience was incredibly impactful and taught me many general professional skills. I learned things such as how to work in a professional team setting, how to manage my time effectively to complete all my tasks, and how to work under the pressure of the busiest days.
Outside of work, I was a member of the National Honor Society through my high school and was awarded the rank of Eagle Scout at age sixteen. During my last semester attending Front Range as a student through Concurrent Enrollment, I was placed on the Dean's List and am currently receiving the President's Merit Scholarship from the Colorado School of Mines.
